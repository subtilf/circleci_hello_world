# What is CircleCI?
CircleCI provides enterprise-class support and services, with the flexibility of a startup. We work where you work: Linux, macOS, Android, and Windows - SaaS or behind your firewall.

Continuous integration (CI) involves the test automation of feature branches before they are merged to the main Git branch in a project. This ensures that a codebase does not get updated with changes that could break something. Continuous Delivery (CD), on the other hand, builds upon CI by automating releases of these branches or the main branch. This allows small incremental updates that reach your users faster, in line with Agile software development philosophy.

# Motivation
After started working with github I needed a CI/CD tool to deploy my codes.

So I selected Circle CI to a test!
